This repository contains supporting materials for the manuscript that
describes our work evaluating the misuse of nonparametric tests in the
presence of heteroscedasticity within nutrition and obesity research.
This work further developed and expanded upon research that was
presented at Obesity Week 2018 (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.14800042). The first
paper published on this work (DOI: 10.1093/ajcn/nqaa357) contains simulations to
describe why misusing nonparametric tests with heteroscedasticity is a
problem and suggests valid alternatives. The aim of the second
manuscript is to show our data on evidence of the problem within
nutrition and obesity research. We originally wanted to publish all of
this data together in one paper, however anonymous peer reviewers
disagreed and insisted we publish separate reports.
