Whether inflammation occurs in periprostatic white adipose tissue (WAT), and contributes to the negative impact of obesity on PC aggressiveness, is unknown.
In a single-center, cross-sectional design, men with newly diagnosed PC undergoing radical prostatectomy were eligible for study participation. The primary objective was to examine the prevalence of periprostatic WAT inflammation defined by the presence of crown-like structures (CLS-P) as detected by CD68 immunohistochemistry. Secondary objectives were to explore the clinical and systemic correlates of periprostatic WAT inflammation. Tumor characteristics and host factors including BMI, adipocyte diameter, and circulating levels of lipids, adipokines, and other metabolic factors were measured. Wilcoxon rank-sum, Chi-square, or Fisher's exact tests, and generalized linear regression were used to examine the association between WAT inflammation and tumor and host characteristics.
Periprostatic fat was collected from 169 men (median age 62 years; median BMI 28.3). Periprostatic WAT inflammation was identified in 49.7% of patients and associated with higher BMI (P=0.02), larger adipocyte size (P=0.004) and Gleason grade groups IV/V tumors (P=0.02). The relationship between WAT inflammation and high Gleason grade remained significant after adjusting for BMI (P=0.04). WAT inflammation correlated with higher circulating levels of insulin, triglycerides, and leptin/adiponectin ratio, and lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol, compared to those without WAT inflammation (P's <0.05).
Periprostatic WAT inflammation is common in this cohort of men with PC and is associated with high-grade PC.Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases advance online publication, 27 June 2017; doi:10.1038/pcan.2017.31.","16301669","9.201536984677","2714769","83","13579559","763","9.8362414698163","268","64","494","270750","14.12454335196","59290","78","211286","19","11.5","11","42","8","A Gucalp","N M Iyengar","X K Zhou","D D Giri","D J Falcone","H Wang","S Williams","M D Krasne","I Yaghnam","B Kunzel","P G Morris","L W Jones","M Pollak","V P Laudone","C A Hudis","H I Scher","P T Scardino","J A Eastham","A J Dannenberg","article","21367754","1.5.4","FALSE","Prostate cancer","Biomarkers","Oncology And Carcinogenesis","npg","npg","era","18","15","15","1575216602","7.7","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","7.7","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/pcan.2017.31","1498559305","1498521600","neoplasms","Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Medicine","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","0","49","0","49","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=8&types=tttttttt","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=8&types=tttttttt","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=8&types=tttttttt","http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=21367754",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While several equations have been offered for estimating total body components from MRI slices, no reliable and tested method exists for CT scans. For the first time, body composition data was derived from 41 high-resolution whole-body CT scans. From these data, we defined equations for estimating volumes and masses of total body AT and LT from corresponding tissue areas measured in selected CT scan slices.
We present a new semi-automatic approach to defining the density cutoff between adipose tissue (AT) and lean tissue (LT) in such material. An intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to validate the method. The equations for estimating the whole-body composition volume and mass from areas measured in selected slices were modeled with ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regressions and support vector machine regression (SVMR).
The best predictive equation for total body AT volume was based on the AT area of a single slice located between the 4th and 5th lumbar vertebrae (L4-L5) and produced lower prediction errors (|PE| = 1.86 liters, %PE = 8.77) than previous equations also based on CT scans. The LT area of the mid-thigh provided the lowest prediction errors (|PE| = 2.52 liters, %PE = 7.08) for estimating whole-body LT volume. We also present equations to predict total body AT and LT masses from a slice located at L4-L5 that resulted in reduced error compared with the previously published equations based on CT scans. The multislice SVMR predictor gave the theoretical upper limit for prediction precision of volumes and cross-validated the results.","10490471","7.3641295158282","7893610","21","2251723","4739","20.428758547911","4000","11","554","263569","12.903070205791","172362","28","75293","358","17.228285714286","294","10","36","Alizé Lacoste Jeanson","Ján Dupej","Chiara Villa","Jaroslav Bružek",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","20277090","1.5.4","FALSE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2","1","2","1495155136","0.75","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0.75","http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.3302","1495155148","1495065600",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0","32","0","32","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=1&types=ttttffff","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=1&types=ttttffff","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=1&types=ttttffff","http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=20277090","2167-8359","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Valid measures of abdominal adiposity are essential to understanding the metabolic consequences of obesity. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is increasingly being utilised to assess body composition in population studies, and has recently been used to estimate visceral adipose tissue (VAT). The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of DXA-derived VAT in a Middle Eastern population using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the criterion measure.
VAT was estimated from abdominal DXA measures in 237 adult men (n=130) and women (n=107), aged 18-65 years, participating in the Kuwait Wellbeing Study. These estimates were compared with MRI measures of the corresponding anatomical region. The agreement between methods was assessed using Bland-Altman as well as correlation analysis.
Median MRI VAT was 1148.5 cm(3) (95% confidence interval: 594.2-1734.6) in men and 711.3 cm(3) (95% confidence interval: 395.5-1042.8) in women. DXA estimates of VAT showed high correlations with corresponding MRI measures (r=0.94 (P<0.0001) in men; r=0.93 (P<0.0001) in women). DXA overestimated VAT with a mean bias (95% limits of agreement) of 79.7 cm(3) (-767 to 963) in men and 46.8 cm(3) (-482 to 866) in women. The imprecision of DXA increased with increasing VAT level in both men and women.
DXA estimates of VAT are valid for use in Middle Eastern populations, although accuracy decreases with increasing level of visceral adiposity.","12549748","7.7601729010015","10041085","11","1384967","253","29.228380952381","212","9","23","338499","11.605670698201","236059","17","60355","12","60.951090909091","7","25","3","A Mohammad","E De Lucia Rolfe","A Sleigh","T Kivisild","K Behbehani","N J Wareham","S Brage","T Mohammad",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","15564608","1.5.4","FALSE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1","1","1","1484743730","0.5","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0.5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nutd.2016.38","1484743742","1483920000",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0","51","0","51","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=1&types=tttttttt","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=1&types=tttttttt","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=1&types=tttttttt","http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=15564608","2044-4052",NA,"http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nutd.2016.38","Epidemiology","npg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Increase in income and the association of potato consumption with weight gain and chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes have been identified as some of the factors responsible for the change. The aim of this study was to describe the change in potato consumption within persons and how non-dietary variables influenced that change among participants in the Norwegian Women and Cancer study (NOWAC). A prospective analysis was performed in the NOWAC cohort using linear regression. Data on dietary, lifestyle, socioeconomic and health-related factors were collected by mailed questionnaires. The change in potato consumption among 38,820 women aged 41-70 years was investigated using two measurements taken at intervals of 4-6 years. At baseline, mean intake was 112g per day; this had decreased to 94.5g per day at the second measurement. Results showed that the percentage of women who reported that they ate less than 1 potato a day increased from 24.6% at baseline to 35.5% at the second measurement. Those who reported that they ate more than 3 potatoes a day had decreased from 20.2% of the participants at baseline to 12.1% at the second measurement. Multivariable adjusted results show that geography was an important predictor of potato consumption at second measurement. Living in the north compared to Oslo (the capital) was associated with higher intake of potato at second measurement (B: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.55-0.65). Compared to women living with a partner, living alone was associated with lower potato intake at second measurement (B: -0.13, 95% CI: -0.17 --0.09) while living with children tended to be associated with higher potato intake at second measurement (B: 0.01, 95% CI: -0.02-0.04). Younger age, more years of education, higher income or BMI was associated with a lower potato intake at second measurement. Smoking was associated with a higher intake of potato at second measurement (B: 0.03, 95% CI: 0.00-0.06 for smokers compared to non-smokers). Having diabetes at baseline was associated with lower intake of potato at second measurement (B: -0.04, 95% CI: -0.14 --0.06 for non-diabetics compared to diabetics). Potato consumption among women in the NOWAC study showed a decline over the period studied. Change in the consumption was found to be influenced by age, education, income, household structure, region of residence as well as health-related factors like smoking and diabetes. The use of repeated measures is necessary to continue the monitoring and also to understand the stability and direction of the possible change in diet of a population.","11410025","7.2836496780236","9132267","11","1292382","126643","11.399356832647","94505","14","18542","263006","13.259446383148","190647","16","42971","3571","12.729535014006","2588","16","578","Ambrose Ojodale Attah","Tonje Braaten","Guri Skeie",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","21335199","1.5.4","FALSE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1","1","1","1498394537","0.5","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0.5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0179441","1498394550","1496966400",NA,"Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Medicine","0","15","0","15","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=1&types=tttttttt","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=1&types=tttttttt","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=1&types=tttttttt","http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=21335199","1932-6203",NA,NA,"Multidisciplinary","era","2017PLoSO..1279441A","science","medicine","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Urine samples were collected 24 hours after injection of cisplatin (7 mg/kg, n = 10) or saline serum (n = 10), and they were subjected to differential centrifugation at 1.000, 17.000 and 200.000 g to obtain microvesicular and exosomal fractions. GluAp was measured with a commercial ELISA kit in both fractions. Serum creatinine (SCr) and body weight were measured 15 days after treatment. We analyzed if early excretion of GluAp in microsomal and exosomal fractions was correlated with final SCr and body weight increase. In a second experiment, enzymatic activities of GluAp and alanyl aminopeptidase (AlaAp) in urine, microvesicular and exosomal fractions were measured three days after injection. We analyzed the correlation of both markers with SCr determined at this point. Finally, we studied the expression of GluAp and extracellular vesicles markers Alix and tumor susceptibility gene (TSG101) in both fractions by immunoblotting.
GluAp excretion was increased in all fractions of urine after cisplatin treatment, even if data were normalized per mg of creatinine, per body weight or per total protein content of each fraction. We found significant predictive correlations with SCr concentration, and inverse correlations with body weight increase determined 15 days later. Three days after injection, aminopeptidasic activities were markedly increased in all fractions of urine in cisplatin-treated rats. The highest correlation coefficient with SCr was found for GluAp in microvesicular fraction. Increase of GluAp in microvesicular and exosomal fractions from cisplatin-treated rats was confirmed by immunoblotting. Alix and TSG101 showed different patterns of expression in each fraction.
Determination of GluAp content or its enzymatic activity in microvesicular and exosomal fractions of urine is an early and predictive biomarker of renal dysfunction in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. Measurement of GluAp in these fractions can serve to detect proximal tubular damage independently of glomerular filtration status.","11426915","7.3186088571121","9148055","11","1287984","126945","11.38017683388","94693","14","18604","266175","13.318828014757","191829","15","41666","4518","11.085995129511","3335","13","626","Andrés Quesada","Ana Belén Segarra","Sebastián Montoro-Molina","María del Carmen de Gracia","Antonio Osuna","Francisco O’Valle","Manuel Gómez-Guzmán","Félix Vargas","Rosemary Wangensteen",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","18731577","1.5.4","FALSE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1","1","1","1491948373","0.5","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0.5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0175462","1491948386","1491868800",NA,"Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Medicine","0","15","0","15","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=1&types=tttttttt","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=1&types=tttttttt","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=1&types=tttttttt","http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=18731577","1932-6203",NA,NA,"Multidisciplinary","era","2017PLoSO..1275462Q","science","medicine","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Body composition was evaluated by bioelectrical impedance analysis, and maximum voluntary contraction torques of the lower limbs were measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. One hundred thirty-two patients were enrolled (100 females and 32 males). Eighty-seven patients had a body mass index between 40 and 49.9 kg/m2 (the A group), and 45 patients had a body mass index between 50 and 59.9 kg/m2 (the B group).
Absolute extension and flexion torques had weak associations with fat-free mass but a moderate association with absolute extension torque and fat-free mass of the lower limbs. There were no significant differences between the A and B groups with respect to absolute extension and flexion torques. For the A group, absolute extension and flexion torques were moderately associated with fat-free mass and with fat-free mass of the lower limbs. For the B group, there were only moderate associations between absolute extension and flexion torques with fat-free mass of the lower limbs.
Our findings demonstrate that both groups exhibited similar absolute torque values. There were weak to moderate associations between absolute extension and flexion torques and fat-free mass but a moderate association with fat-free mass of the lower limbs.

There are a lack of studies examining the prevalence of non-responders (NRs) in children while considering other potential environmental factors involved such as biological maturation. Aim: To compare the effects and prevalence of NRs to improve the insulin resistance level (by HOMA-IR), as well as to other anthropometric, cardiovascular, and performance co-variables, between early (EM) and normal maturation (NM) in insulin-resistance schoolchildren after 6-weeks of HIIT. Methods: Sedentary children (age 11.4 ± 1.7 years) were randomized to either HIIT-EM group (n = 12) or HIIT-NM group (n = 17). Fasting glucose (FGL), fasting insulin (FINS) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistant (HOMA-IR) were assessed as the main outcomes, as well as the body composition [body mass, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and tricipital (TSF), suprailiac (SSF) and abdominal skinfold (AbdSF)], cardiovascular systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and muscular performance [one-repetition maximum strength leg-extension (1RMLE) and upper row (1RMUR) tests] co-variables were assessed before and after intervention. Responders or NRs to training were defined as a change in the typical error method from baseline to follow-up for the main outcomes and co-variables. Results: There were no significant differences between groups in the prevalence of NRs based on FGL, FINS, and HOMA-IR. There were significant differences in NRs prevalence to decrease co-variables body mass (HIIT-EM 66.6% vs. HIIT-NM 35.2%) and SBP (HIIT-EM 41.6% vs. HIIT-NM 70.5%). A high risk [based on odds ratios (OR)] of NRs cases was detected for FGL, OR = 3.2 (0.2 to 5.6), and HOMA-IR, OR = 3.2 (0.2 to 6.0). Additionally, both HIIT-EM and HIIT-NM groups showed significant decreases (P < 0.05) in TSF, SSF, and AbdSF skinfold, and similar decreases in fasting insulin and HOMA-IR. The HIIT-EM group showed significant decreases in SBP. The HIIT-NM group showed significant increases in 1RMLE and 1RMUR. A large effect size was observed for pre-post changes in TSF in both groups, as well as in SSF in the HIIT-NM group. Conclusion: Although there were no differences in the prevalence of NRs to metabolic variables between groups of insulin resistance schoolchildren of different maturation starting, other NRs differences were found to body mass and systolic BP, suggesting that anthropometric and cardiovascular parameters can be playing a role in the NRs prevalence after HIIT. These results were displayed with several metabolic, body composition, blood pressure, and performance improvements independent of an early/normal maturation or the prevalence of NRs.","15305941","8.7869079860431","1223913","91","14079936","7289","7.3022425905598","613","91","6673","271001","13.685231579335","34014","87","236901","227","4.7546017699115","13","94","214","Cristian Alvarez","Rodrigo Ramírez-Campillo","Robinson Ramírez-Vélez","Mikel Izquierdo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","20970486","1.5.4","FALSE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"29","26","26","1498893377","15.1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","15.1","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2017.00444","1497276336","1498694400",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0","109","0","109","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=16&types=tttttttt","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=16&types=tttttttt","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=16&types=tttttttt","http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=20970486","1664-042X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study assessed the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and the prevalence of NRs in adult women with higher and lower levels of insulin resistance. Methods: Forty adult women were assigned to a HIIT program, and after training were analyzed in two groups; a group with higher insulin resistance (H-IR, 40 ± 6 years; BMI: 29.5 ± 3.7 kg/m(2); n = 20) and a group with lower insulin resistance (L-IR, 35 ± 9 years; 27.8 ± 2.8 kg/m(2); n = 20). Anthropometric, cardiovascular, metabolic, and performance variables were measured at baseline and after 10 weeks of training. Results: There were significant training-induced changes [delta percent (<U+0394>%)] in fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) scores in the H-IR group (-8.8, -26.5, -32.1%, p < 0.0001), whereas no significant changes were observed in the L-IR. Both groups showed significant pre-post changes in other anthropometric variables [waist circumference (-5.2, p < 0.010, and -3.8%, p = 0.046) and tricipital (-13.3, p < 0.010, and -13.6%, p < 0.0001), supra-iliac (-19.4, p < 0.0001, and -13.6%, p < 0.0001), and abdominal (-18.2, p < 0.0001, and -15.6%, p < 0.010) skinfold measurements]. Systolic blood pressure decreased significantly only in the L-IR group (-3.2%, p < 0.010). Both groups showed significant increases in 1RMLE (+12.9, p < 0.010, and +14.7%, p = 0.045). There were significant differences in the prevalence of NRs between the H-IR and L-IR groups for fasting glucose (25 vs. 95%, p < 0.0001) and fasting insulin (p = 0.025) but not for HOMA-IR (25 vs. 45%, p = 0.185). Conclusion: Independent of the ""magnitude"" of the cardiometabolic disease (i.e., higher vs. lower insulin resistance), no differences were observed in the NRs prevalence with regard to improved HOMA-IR or to anthropometric, cardiovascular, and muscle performance co-variables after 10 weeks of HIIT in sedentary adult women. This research demonstrates the protective effect of HIIT against cardiometabolic disease progression in a sedentary population.","16110448","9.1250455680049","129212","99","15981429","7883","7.3459906115199","56","99","7828","270202","14.09012559539","4489","98","265713","235","4.3749572649573","2","99","233","Cristian Álvarez","Rodrigo Ramírez-Campillo","Robinson Ramírez-Vélez","Mikel Izquierdo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","21260499","1.5.4","FALSE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"64","31","53","1506105532","155.756","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","155.756","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2017.00479","1498121620","1499299200",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0","98","0","98","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=156&types=mmbrtttf","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=156&types=mmbrtttf","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=156&types=mmbrtttf","http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=21260499","1664-042X","3",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"17","1","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1) participates in neurobiological pathways involved in both mood and energy balance regulation. Crtc1 -/- mice rapidly develop a depressive-like and obese phenotype in early adulthood, and are therefore a relevant animal model to explore possible common mechanisms underlying mood disorders and obesity. Here, the obese phenotype of male and female Crtc1 -/- mice was further characterized by investigating CRTC1's role in the homeostatic and hedonic regulation of food intake, as well as its influence on daily locomotor activity. Crtc1 -/- mice showed a strong gender difference in the homeostatic regulation of energy balance. Mutant males were hyperphagic and rapidly developed obesity on normal chow diet, whereas Crtc1 -/- females exhibited mild late-onset obesity without hyperphagia. Overeating of mutant males was accompanied by alterations in the expression of several orexigenic and anorexigenic hypothalamic genes, thus confirming a key role of CRTC1 in the central regulation of food intake. No alteration in preference and conditioned response for saccharine was observed in Crtc1 -/- mice, suggesting that mutant males' hyperphagia was not due to an altered hedonic regulation of food intake. Intriguingly, mutant males exhibited a hyperphagic behavior only during the resting (diurnal) phase of the light cycle. This abnormal feeding behavior was associated with a higher diurnal locomotor activity indicating that the lack of CRTC1 may affect circadian rhythmicity. Collectively, these findings highlight the male-specific involvement of CRTC1 in the central control of energy balance and circadian locomotor activity.","12269011","7.6001902115816","10873681","1","0","1409","21.519160511364","1324","1","0","344109","11.744865088866","285274","1","0","58","14.236105263158","54","1","0","Clara Rossetti","Daniel Sciarra","Jean-Marie Petit","Chin B.

Socio-demographic and anthropometric variables, adherence to the Mediterranean diet, aerobic fitness, and healthy lifestyles were recorded.
Boys reported a higher level of physical activity and aerobic fitness than girls (p = 0.000). Southern school children reported significantly higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet (<U+2640>: p = 0.041; <U+2642>: p = 0.008), lower aerobic fitness (<U+2640>: p = 0.000; <U+2642>: p = 0.042) and hours of nightly sleep (<U+2640>: p = 0.008, <U+2642>: p = 0.007) than northern school children. Southern boys also reported lower levels of physical activity (p = 0.013). There were slight or moderate correlations among all habits measured (physical activity, diet, screen and sleep time). Additionally, the physical activity level was inversely related to weight status. Overweight and obese northern boys reported less physical activity than healthy-weight northern boys (p = 0.020) and overweight and obese southern girls reported less physical activity than healthy-weight southern girls (p = 0.024).

In pediatric populations, there is a pronounced decrease in heart rate with age. While this decrease is often interpreted as an age-related increase in vagal tone, there is some evidence that it may be related to a decrease in intrinsic heart rate. This factor has not been taken into account in most previous studies. The aim of the present study was to assess the association between physical activity and/or body composition and heart rate variability (HRV) independently of the decline in heart rate in young children. Methods: Anthropometric measurements were taken in 309 children aged 2-6 years. Ambulatory electrocardiograms were collected over 14-18 h comprising a full night and accelerometry over 7 days. HRV was determined of three different night segments: (1) over 5 min during deep sleep identified automatically based on HRV characteristics; (2) during a 20 min segment starting 15 min after sleep onset; (3) over a 4-h segment between midnight and 4 a.m. Linear models were computed for HRV parameters with anthropometric and physical activity variables adjusted for heart rate and other confounding variables (e.g., age for physical activity models). Results: We found a decline in heart rate with increasing physical activity and decreasing skinfold thickness. HRV parameters decreased with increasing age, height, and weight in HR-adjusted regression models. These relationships were only found in segments of deep sleep detected automatically based on HRV or manually 15 min after sleep onset, but not in the 4-h segment with random sleep phases. Conclusions: Contrary to most previous studies, we found no increase of standard HRV parameters with age, however, when adjusted for heart rate, there was a significant decrease of HRV parameters with increasing age. Without knowing intrinsic heart rate correct interpretation of HRV in growing children is impossible.","13350484","8.0443708894908","3304417","75","10032708","6063","7.1743032002639","1237","79","4814","258033","14.172205974452","78784","69","178723","200","5.1754773869347","44","78","156","David Herzig","Prisca Eser","Thomas Radtke","Alina Wenger","Thomas Rusterholz","Matthias Wilhelm","Peter Achermann","Amar Arhab","Oskar G.

Yet, few studies have examined the relations of different body fat compartments to urinary and serum metabolites. Anthropometric phenotypes (visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), the ratio between VAT and SAT (VSR), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC)) and urinary and serum metabolite concentrations measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were measured in a population-based sample of 228 healthy adults. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models, corrected for multiple testing using the false discovery rate, were used to associate anthropometric phenotypes with metabolites. We adjusted for potential confounding variables: age, sex, smoking, physical activity, menopausal status, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary glucose, and fasting status. In a fully adjusted logistic regression model dichotomized for the absence or presence of quantifiable metabolite amounts, VAT, BMI and WC were inversely related to urinary choline (ß = -0.18, p = 2.73*10-3), glycolic acid (ß = -0.20, 0.02), and guanidinoacetic acid (ß = -0.12, p = 0.04), and positively related to ethanolamine (ß = 0.18, p = 0.02) and dimethylamine (ß = 0.32, p = 0.02). BMI and WC were additionally inversely related to urinary glutamine and lactic acid. Moreover, WC was inversely associated with the detection of serine. VAT, but none of the other anthropometric parameters, was related to serum essential amino acids, such as valine, isoleucine, and phenylalanine among men. Compared to other adiposity measures, VAT demonstrated the strongest and most significant relations to urinary and serum metabolites. The distinct relations of VAT, SAT, VSR, BMI, and WC to metabolites emphasize the importance of accurately differentiating between body fat compartments when evaluating the potential role of metabolic regulation in the development of obesity-related diseases, such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.","12247570","7.5882904751032","9786184","11","1392425","134105","11.618526233371","99375","15","20229","265681","13.364449789219","191449","15","41165","4455","11.125474180512","3288","13","612","Inga Schlecht","Wolfram Gronwald","Gundula Behrens","Sebastian E.

Postpartum weight retention in the childbearing years can substantially alter a woman's weight gain trajectory, with several potential contributing factors identified. Most research has relied on women's recall of pre-pregnancy weight during pregnancy or later, and not considered risk factors in combination. Using measured pre-pregnancy weight, this study aimed to examine the associations of maternal postpartum weight retention with parity, pre-pregnancy BMI, excessive gestational weight gain (GWG), maternal serum vitamin D concentration and dietary Glycaemic Index in early and late pregnancy and breastfeeding duration, including analysis of the combined impact of potentially modifiable risk factors.
Prospective cohort study of 12 583 non-pregnant women aged 20-34 years in Southampton (UK) who were assessed prior to pregnancy, with those who subsequently became pregnant followed up in early and late gestation, and after delivery (n=2559 in the final sample). Linear regression models examined potential predictors of weight retention in adjusted individual and multivariate analyses, and as a risk factor score.
Compared with pre-pregnancy weight, 73% of women retained some weight at six months postpartum [mean (s.d.): 3.5 (6.2) kg]. In the adjusted multivariate model, women who were primiparous, had a lower pre-pregnancy BMI, excessive GWG, a lower early pregnancy vitamin D concentration and breastfed for <6 months had greater weight retention six months postpartum (P<0.05 for all variables). For each additional modifiable risk factor (excessive GWG, low vitamin D concentration in early pregnancy and short breastfeeding duration; scale 0-3), women retained an additional 2.49 kg (95%CI: 2.16, 2.82; P<0.001).
Having a greater number of modifiable risk factors was associated with greater weight retention six months postpartum. Initiatives supporting women to target these risk factors in the years prior to, during and after pregnancy could impact on their weight gain trajectory and later risk of adverse weight related outcomes.International Journal of Obesity accepted article preview online, 24 March 2017. doi:10.1038/ijo.2017.78.","15277053","8.7745869422888","664530","95","14610158","3577","18.614420581655","417","88","3158","265112","14.407578244584","20860","92","244207","55","24.815851851852","9","83","46","J L Hollis","S R Crozier","H M Inskip","C Cooper","K M Godfrey","N C Harvey","C E Collins","S M Robinson",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","18189820","1.5.4","FALSE","Medical And Health Sciences","Education",NA,"era","era",NA,"15","10","13","1540990808","30","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","30","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ijo.2017.78","1490708166","1490313600","metabolism","Health Sciences","Nursing","Medicine",NA,"1","60","0","61","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=30&types=mmtttttt","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=30&types=mmtttttt","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=30&types=mmtttttt","http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=18189820",NA,NA,"http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ijo.2017.78",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the progressive form of NAFLD, is characterized by hepatic steatosis, inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrosis. NASH is a risk factor for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. NASH is predicted to be the leading cause of liver transplants by 2020. Despite this growing public health concern, there remain no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved NASH treatments. Using Ldlr -/- mice as a preclinical model of western diet (WD)-induced NASH, we previously established that dietary supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6,<U+03C9>3) attenuated WD-induced NASH in a prevention study. Herein, we evaluated the capacity of DHA supplementation of the WD and a low fat diet to fully reverse NASH in mice with pre-existing disease.
Ldlr -/- mice fed the WD for 22 wks developed metabolic syndrome (MetS) and a severe NASH phenotype, including obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, hepatic steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis and low hepatic polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content. These mice were randomized to 5 groups: a baseline group (WDB, sacrificed at 22 wks) and 4 treatments: 1) WD + olive oil (WDO); 2) WD + DHA (WDD); 3) returned to chow + olive oil (WDChO); or 4) returned to chow + DHA (WDChD). The four treatment groups were maintained on their respective diets for 8 wks. An additional group was maintained on standard laboratory chow (Reference Diet, RD) for the 30-wk duration of the study.
When compared to the WDB group, the WDO group displayed increased hepatic expression of genes linked to inflammation (Opn, Il1rn, Gdf15), hepatic fibrosis (collagen staining, Col1A1, Thbs2, Lox) reflecting disease progression. Mice in the WDD group, in contrast, had increased hepatic C20-22 <U+03C9>3 PUFA and no evidence of NASH progression. MetS and NASH markers in the WDChO or WDChD groups were significantly attenuated and marginally different from the RD group, reflecting disease remission.
While these studies establish that DHA supplementation of the WD blocks WD-induced NASH progression, DHA alone does not promote full remission of diet-induced MetS or NASH.","13770158","8.2273756855374","125956","99","13644184","145314","12.280856936406","2522","98","142792","263785","13.771935598823","5426","97","258358","4472","11.022254081861","73","98","4399","Kelli A.

Peripheral actions of leptin occur at lower serum levels of the hormone than central actions because entry of leptin into the central nervous system (CNS) is limited due to its saturable transport across the blood brain barrier (BBB). We performed a study in mice to model the impact of leptin production associated with different levels of adiposity on bone formation and compared the response with well-established centrally-mediated actions of the hormone on energy metabolism. Leptin was infused (0, 4, 12, 40, 140, or 400 ng/h) for 12 days into 6-week-old female ob/ob mice (n=8/group) using sc implanted osmotic pumps. Treatment resulted in a dose-associated increase in serum leptin. Bone formation parameters were increased at EC50 infusion rates of 7-17 ng/h whereas higher levels (EC50, 40-80 ng/h) were required to similarly impact indices of energy metabolism. We then analyzed gene expression in tibia and hypothalamus at dose rates of 0, 12 and 140 ng/h; the latter dose resulted in serum leptin levels similar to WT mice. Infusion with 12 ng/h leptin increased expression of genes associated with Jak/Stat signaling and bone formation in tibia with minimal effect on Jak/Stat signaling and neurotransmitters in hypothalamus. The results suggest that leptin acts peripherally to couple bone acquisition to energy availability and that limited transport across the BBB insures that the growth promoting actions of peripheral leptin are not curtailed by the hormone's CNS-mediated anorexigenic actions.","13964301","8.235219245063","8038144","40","5639555","1973","5.1856693711968","1449","25","494","262792","14.116251797055","131030","46","123163","47","11.344956521739","29","34","16","Kenneth A Philbrick","Carmen P Wong","Adam J Branscum","Russell T Turner","Urszula T Iwaniec",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","18258663","1.5.4","FALSE","Clinical Sciences","Veterinary Sciences","Animal Production","era","era","era","3","3","3","1490883426","1.5","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1.5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1530/joe-16-0484","1490867131","1488326400","endocrinology","Health Sciences","Medicine",NA,NA,"0","26","0","26","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=2&types=tttttttt","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=2&types=tttttttt","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=2&types=tttttttt","http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=18258663",NA,NA,"http://joe.endocrinology-journals.org/lookup/doi/10.1530/JOE-16-0484",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We tested the hypothesis that human, umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from infants born to obese (Ob-MSC) versus normal weight (NW-MSC) mothers demonstrate altered fatty acid metabolism consistent with adult obesity. In infant MSCs undergoing myogenesis in vitro, we measured cellular lipid metabolism and AMPK activity, AMPK activation in response to cellular nutrient stress, and MSC DNA methylation and mRNA content of genes related to oxidative metabolism.
We found that Ob-MSCs exhibit greater lipid accumulation, lower fatty acid oxidation (FAO), and dysregulation of AMPK activity when undergoing myogenesis in vitro. Further experiments revealed a clear phenotype distinction within the Ob-MSC group where more severe MSC metabolic perturbation corresponded to greater neonatal adiposity and umbilical cord blood insulin levels. Targeted analysis of DNA methylation array revealed Ob-MSC hypermethylation in genes regulating FAO (PRKAG2, ACC2, CPT1A, SDHC) and corresponding lower mRNA content of these genes. Moreover, MSC methylation was positively correlated with infant adiposity.
These data suggest that greater infant adiposity is associated with suppressed AMPK activity and reduced lipid oxidation in MSCs from infants born to mothers with obesity and may be an important, early marker of underlying obesity risk.","15748200","8.983207713077","2888599","81","12852352","931","13.467913978495","397","57","533","274693","13.825470250316","65769","75","208694","44","24.322930232558","26","40","18","Kristen E.

Participants from the CARDIA study (Y25 exam; age 43-55 years) with concurrent computed tomography quantification of liver fat, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and brain magnetic resonance (MR) images were included (n = 505). NAFLD was identified after exclusion of other causes of liver fat. Total tissue volume (TTV) and gray matter cerebral blood flow (GM-CBF) were estimated using 3T brain MR images.
NAFLD prevalence was 18%. NAFLD was associated with lower TTV and GM-CBF after adjusting for intracranial volume, demographics, and health behaviors (P < 0.04 for all). In models with additional adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, the association of NAFLD with GM-CBF remained significant (P = 0.04) but was attenuated after adjustment for VAT (P = 0.06) and eliminated with BMI (P = 0.20). NAFLD was not associated with TTV after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors (P = 0.10) or additional adjustment for VAT (P = 0.14) or BMI (P = 0.05).
NAFLD is negatively associated with early brain health as assessed by MR measures of structure (TTV) and perfusion (GM-CBF). BMI and VAT attenuated this relationship, providing insight into the potential metabolic role of liver fat in brain health and disease.","12459153","7.7249784311055","2993985","75","9452411","2902","25.196168217856","1341","53","1556","337542","11.97172636213","93342","72","243559","111","41.918872727273","59","45","51","Lisa B.

This study assesses the impact of long-term, successfully maintained weight loss and weight-loss relapse on measures of insulin sensitivity and identifies factors that explain variability in insulin sensitivity.
Women (20-45 years) were recruited into four groups: reduced-overweight/obese (RED, n=15); body mass index (BMI)-matched controls (stable low-weight, n=19), BMI<U+2A7D>27 kg m(-2); relapsed-overweight/obese subjects (REL, n=11); and BMI-matched controls (obese stable weight, n=11), BMI<U+2A7E>27 kg m(-2). A 75 g oral glucose tolerance test determined fasting and 2 h plasma glucose and insulin. Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) and insulin sensitivity index (ISI(0,120)) assessed insulin sensitivity. Anthropometric measurements, fasting resting metabolic rate (RMR) and respiratory quotient (RQ) were measured. Questionnaires and dietary intake were recorded, and physical activity was measured using accelerometers.
RED were more insulin sensitive, characterised by lower fasting (P=0.001) and 2 h insulin (P=0.003) levels compared with all other groups. There were no significant differences in dietary intake, sedentary, light and moderate activity, RMR or RQ in the RED compared with the other three groups. % Body weight (BW) lost (P<0.001), % BW regained (P<0.05), body fat %, light activity (P<0.05, only log HOMA), vigorous activity (P<0.05) and RQ (P<0.01) predicted 61.4% and 59.7% of variability in log HOMA and log ISI(0,120), respectively, in multiple linear regression models.
This study showed sustained enhanced insulin sensitivity in successful weight loss maintainers compared with BMI-matched controls with no weight loss history. Weight-loss-relapsed individuals were indistinguishable from controls. Weight loss itself was the strongest predictor of improved insulin sensitivity, whereas weight regain significantly predicted reduced insulin sensitivity. Weight-loss maintenance programs are essential to retaining metabolic benefits acquired through weight loss. Being physically active, reducing sedentary behaviour and, in particular, including small amounts of vigorous physical activity significantly predicted improved insulin sensitivity.","16348461","9.2129260403743","506892","96","15841258","349","27.727396551724","34","90","315","270837","14.114014872468","15136","94","255685","4","7.9833333333333","1","75","3","L D Clamp","D J Hume","E V Lambert","J Kroff",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","21213450","1.5.4","FALSE","Obesity","Risk factors",NA,"npg","npg",NA,"16","6","16","1599443491","46.25","27.25","27.25","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","46.25","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nutd.2017.31","1498028718","1497830400",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0","74","0","74","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=47&types=mmvvtttf","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=47&types=mmvvtttf","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=47&types=mmvvtttf","http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=21213450","2044-4052","2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, we genetically mapped the chromosomal region underlying the development of severe obesity in a mouse line identified as part of a dominant N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen. We characterized the metabolic and behavioral phenotype of obese mutant mice and examined changes in hypothalamic gene expression. In humans, we examined genetic data from people with severe early onset obesity.
We identified an obese mouse heterozygous for a missense mutation (pR108W) in orthopedia homeobox (Otp), a homeodomain containing transcription factor required for the development of neuroendocrine cell lineages in the hypothalamus, a region of the brain important in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Otp(R108W/+) mice exhibit increased food intake, weight gain, and anxiety when in novel environments or singly housed, phenotypes that may be partially explained by reduced hypothalamic expression of oxytocin and arginine vasopressin. R108W affects the highly conserved homeodomain, impairs DNA binding, and alters transcriptional activity in cells. We sequenced OTP in 2548 people with severe early-onset obesity and found a rare heterozygous loss of function variant in the homeodomain (Q153R) in a patient who also had features of attention deficit disorder.
OTP is involved in mammalian energy homeostasis and behavior and appears to be necessary for the development of hypothalamic neural circuits. Further studies will be needed to investigate the contribution of rare variants in OTP to human energy homeostasis.","12298022","7.6109638049746","954784","92","11340642","644","12.829443234837","117","81","527","268665","13.262992600422","36356","86","232219","31","25.881","9","70","22","Lee Moir","Elena G.

Exercise capacity may be assessed using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). Whether statin medication is associated with CPET parameters is unclear. We investigated if statins are related with exercise capacity during CPET in the general population.
Cross-sectional data of two independent cohorts of the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) were merged (n = 3,500; 50% males). Oxygen consumption (VO2) at peak exercise (VO2peak) and anaerobic threshold (VO2@AT) was assessed during symptom-limited CPET. Two linear regression models related VO2peak with statin usage were calculated. Model 1 adjusted for age, sex, previous myocardial infarction, and physical inactivity and model 2 additionally for body mass index, smoking, hypertension, diabetes and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Propensity score matching was used for validation.
Statin usage was associated with lower VO2peak (no statin: 2336; 95%-confidence interval [CI]: 2287-2,385 vs. statin 2090; 95%-CI: 2,031-2149 ml/min; P < .0001) and VO2@AT (no statin: 1,172; 95%-CI: 1,142-1,202 vs. statin: 1,111; 95%-CI: 1,075-1,147 ml/min; P = .0061) in males but not females (VO2peak: no statin: 1,467; 95%-CI: 1,417-1,517 vs. statin: 1,503; 95%-CI: 1,426-1,579 ml/min; P = 1.00 and VO2@AT: no statin: 854; 95%-CI: 824-885 vs. statin 864; 95%-CI: 817-911 ml/min; P = 1.00).

Various animal models of intrauterine growth restriction exhibit reduced heart size at birth, which negatively influences cardiac function in adulthood. The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) integrates nutrient and growth factor availability with cell growth, thereby regulating organ size. This study aimed at elucidating a possible involvement of mTORC1 in intrauterine growth restriction and prenatal heart growth.
We inhibited mTORC1 in fetal mice by rapamycin treatment of pregnant dams in late gestation. Prenatal rapamycin treatment reduces mTORC1 activity in various organs at birth, which is fully restored by postnatal day 3. Rapamycin-treated neonates exhibit a 16% reduction in body weight compared with vehicle-treated controls. Heart weight decreases by 35%, resulting in a significantly reduced heart weight/body weight ratio, smaller left ventricular dimensions, and reduced cardiac output in rapamycin- versus vehicle-treated mice at birth. Although proliferation rates in neonatal rapamycin-treated hearts are unaffected, cardiomyocyte size is reduced, and apoptosis increased compared with vehicle-treated neonates. Rapamycin-treated mice exhibit postnatal catch-up growth, but body weight and left ventricular mass remain reduced in adulthood. Prenatal mTORC1 inhibition causes a reduction in cardiomyocyte number in adult hearts compared with controls, which is partially compensated for by an increased cardiomyocyte volume, resulting in normal cardiac function without maladaptive left ventricular remodeling.
Prenatal rapamycin treatment of pregnant dams represents a new mouse model of intrauterine growth restriction and identifies an important role of mTORC1 in perinatal cardiac growth.","15507566","8.8856662866065","2988558","80","12510654","4522","23.54104003539","1671","62","2840","271860","14.075897358557","68934","74","202608","160","24.395735849057","51","67","108","Maria Hennig","Saskia Fiedler","Christian Jux","Ludwig Thierfelder","Jörg-Detlef Drenckhahn",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","23472488","1.5.4","FALSE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"12","12","12","1564061986","6.1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","6.1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/jaha.117.005506","1502014740","1501632000","cardiology",NA,NA,NA,NA,"0","26","0","26","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=7&types=tttttttt","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=7&types=tttttttt","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=7&types=tttttttt","http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=23472488",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, their impact on whole-body insulin sensitivity using the hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp technique remains under-studied. We aimed to determine the effects of strawberry and cranberry polyphenols (SCP) on insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, insulin secretion, lipid profile, inflammation and oxidative stress markers in free-living insulin-resistant overweight or obese human subjects (n 41) in a parallel, double-blind, controlled and randomised clinical trial. The experimental group consumed an SCP beverage (333 mg SCP) daily for 6 weeks, whereas the Control group received a flavour-matched Control beverage that contained 0 mg SCP. At the beginning and at the end of the experimental period, insulin sensitivity was assessed by a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp, and glucose tolerance and insulin secretion by a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Insulin sensitivity increased in the SCP group as compared with the Control group (+0·9 (sem 0·5)×10-3 v. -0·5 (sem 0·5)×10-3 mg/kg per min per pmol, respectively, P=0·03). Compared with the Control group, the SCP group had a lower first-phase insulin secretion response as measured by C-peptide levels during the first 30 min of the OGTT (P=0·002). No differences were detected between the two groups for lipids and markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. A 6-week dietary intervention with 333 mg of polyphenols from strawberries and cranberries improved insulin sensitivity in overweight and obese non-diabetic, insulin-resistant human subjects but was not effective in improving other cardiometabolic risk factors.","16291420","9.1989734939505","131340","99","16160100","5172","14.770959195513","77","98","5095","307781","14.598871206706","5138","98","302641","61","19.5192","4","93","57","Martine Paquette","Ana S.

Therefore, we investigated the efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitor on endothelial function and glycemic metabolism compared with high-dose metformin.
In this multicenter, open-labeled, prospective, randomized, parallel-group comparison study, patients with type 2 diabetes treated with low-dose metformin (500-750 mg/day) were enrolled and randomly assigned to a vildagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, add-on group (Vilda) or a double dose of metformin group (high Met) for 12 weeks. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and serum metabolic markers were assessed before and after treatment. In addition, glycemic control and metabolic parameters were also assessed.
Ninety-seven subjects (aged 58.7 ± 11.0 years; body mass index, 25.9 ± 4.4 kg/m(2); HbA1c, 7.3 ± 0.5%; FMD, 5.8 ± 2.6%) were enrolled. Eight subjects dropped out by the end of the study. There were no significant differences between the two groups in baseline characteristics. After 12 weeks, HbA1c was significantly improved in the Vilda group compared with the high Met group (- 0.80 ± 0.38% vs. - 0.40 ± 0.47%, respectively; p < 0.01). However, there were no significant differences in FMD (- 0.51 [- 1.08-0.06]% vs. - 0.58 [- 1.20-0.04]%). Although the apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 ratio was significantly reduced in the Vilda group compared with baseline (0.66-0.62; p < 0.01), the change did not differ significantly between the two groups (- 0.04 vs. 0.00; p = 0.27).

Our recent observational data show that amounts of energy/protein received early in the intensive care unit (ICU) affect patient mortality, particularly for inadequate nutrition intake in patients with body mass indices (BMIs) of <25 or >35. Thus, we hypothesized increased nutrition delivery via supplemental PN (SPN) + enteral nutrition (EN) to underweight and obese ICU patients would improve 60-day survival and quality of life (QoL) versus usual care (EN alone).
In this multicenter, randomized, controlled pilot trial completed in 11 centers across four countries, adult ICU patients with acute respiratory failure expected to require mechanical ventilation for >72 hours and with a BMI of <25 or =35 were randomized to receive EN alone or SPN + EN to reach 100% of their prescribed nutrition goal for 7 days after randomization. The primary aim of this pilot trial was to achieve a 30% improvement in nutrition delivery.
In total, 125 patients were enrolled. Over the first 7 post-randomization ICU days, patients in the SPN + EN arm had a 26% increase in delivered calories and protein, whereas patients in the EN-alone arm had a 22% increase (both p < 0.001). Surgical ICU patients received poorer EN nutrition delivery and had a significantly greater increase in calorie and protein delivery when receiving SPN versus medical ICU patients. SPN proved feasible to deliver with our prescribed protocol. In this pilot trial, no significant outcome differences were observed between groups, including no difference in infection risk. Potential, although statistically insignificant, trends of reduced hospital mortality and improved discharge functional outcomes and QoL outcomes in the SPN + EN group versus the EN-alone group were observed.
Provision of SPN + EN significantly increased calorie/protein delivery over the first week of ICU residence versus EN alone. This was achieved with no increased infection risk. Given feasibility and consistent encouraging trends in hospital mortality, QoL, and functional endpoints, a full-scale trial of SPN powered to assess these clinical outcome endpoints in high-nutritional-risk ICU patients is indicated-potentially focusing on the more poorly EN-fed surgical ICU setting.

Moreover, studies relating continuous postprandial sensations of satiation to measurable pathology are scarce. This work assessed postprandial gastrointestinal function and concurrent sensations of satiation across a wide range of body weight and after weight change.
Patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) and obesity (OB) were investigated in reference to normal weight controls (HC). AN were additionally investigated longitudinally. Gastric emptying, antral contractions and oro-cecal transit after ingestion of a solid meal were investigated by MRI and (13)C-lactose-ureide breath test. The dependency of self-reported sensations of satiation on the varying degree of stomach filling during gastric emptying was compared between groups.
24 AN (BMI 14.4 (11.9-16.0) kg/m(2)), 16 OB (34.9 (29.6-41.5) kg/m(2)) and 20 HC (21.9 (18.9-24.9) kg/m(2)) were studied. Gastric half-emptying time (t50) was slower in AN than HC (p = 0.016) and OB (p = 0.007), and a negative association between t50 and BMI was observed between BMI 12 and 25 kg/m(2) (p = 0.007). Antral contractions and oro-cecal transit were not different. For any given gastric content volume, self-reported postprandial fullness was greater in AN than in HC or OB (p < 0.001). After weight rehabilitation, t50 in AN tended to become shorter (p = 0.09) and postprandial fullness was less marked (p < 0.01).
A relationship between body weight and gastric emptying as well as self-reported feelings of satiation is present. AN have slower gastric emptying and heightened visceral perception compared to HC and OB. Longitudinal follow-up after weight rehabilitation in AN suggests these abnormalities are not a primary feature, but secondary to other factors that determine abnormal body weight.

The aim of this study was to determine the influence of FBG on lean mass (LM), fat mass (FM) and their distribution (trunk vs. appendicular), separately in middle-aged men and women.
One thousand nine hundred and eleven (1,911) men (63.9 ± 11.7 years) and 1,977 women (63.7 ± 12.1 years) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999 - 2004) were divided into four groups: normal glucose tolerance (NGT), low impaired fasting glucose (IFG), high IFG and T2DM. Body composition was obtained from dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).
Of the patients, 68.7% had NGT, 16.1% low IFG, 9.4% high IFG and 5.8% T2DM. After adjustment for age, body mass index, ethnicity, smoking, alcohol and physical activity (PA), no change in appendicular LM was observed between groups, but significant increases in trunk FM (in both gender) and trunk LM (in women) were found with increased glucose intolerance (T2DM > IFG > NGT), as well as significant decreases in trunk and total LM/FM ratios (T2DM < IFG < NGT) and a significant increase in trunk/appendicular FM ratio (T2DM > IFG > NGT).
Elevated FBG within the normal range is not associated with a significant loss of appendicular LM, but modifications in LM and FM trunk and total distribution with IFG suggest that nutritional and physical lifestyle strategies should be implemented in the pre-diabetic state.","12016495","7.515665833962","9614576","11","1359762","290","2.678615916955","179","25","75","283860","12.691032146241","206362","16","45628","2","1","2","1","0","Julian, Valerie","Blondel, Romain","Pereira, Bruno","Thivel, David","Boirie, Yves","Duclos, Martine",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"article","27646358","1.5.4","FALSE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1","1","1","1508415193","0.5","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0.5","http://dx.doi.org/10.14740/jocmr3142w","1508415210","1509494400",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0","18","0","18","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=1&types=tttttttt","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=1&types=tttttttt","https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=1&types=tttttttt","http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=27646358","1918-3003",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This combined with the prohibitive financial cost and ethical concerns to measure key metabolic parameters repeatedly in subjects for the major part of their life span makes that comprehensive longitudinal human data sets are virtually nonexistent. While experimental mice are often used, little is known whether this species is in fact an adequate model to better understand the mechanisms that drive the metabolic syndrome in man. We took up the challenge to study the response of male apoE*3-Leiden.CETP mice (with a humanized lipid profile) to a high-fat high-cholesterol diet for 6 months. Study parameters include body weight, food intake, plasma and liver lipids, hepatic transcriptome, VLDL - triglyceride production and importantly the use of stable isotopes to measure hepatic de novo lipogenesis, gluconeogenesis, and biliary/fecal sterol secretion to assess metabolic fluxes. The key observations include (1) high inter-individual variation; (2) a largely unaffected hepatic transcriptome at 2, 3, and 6 months; (3) a biphasic response curve of the main metabolic features over time; and (4) maximum insulin resistance preceding dyslipidemia. The biphasic response in plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol appears to mimic that of men in cross-sectional studies.
