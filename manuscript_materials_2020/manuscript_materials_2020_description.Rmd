## Project Description 

This project studied the prevalence and impact of the error of using classic nonparametric tests in the presence of heteroscedasticity within nutrition obesity research. Simulations that describe why this is a problem have been published by our team (DOI:10.1093/ajcn/nqaa357). This repository contains the data and code used to substantiate the manuscript. The full manuscript, which includes methodological details, will be added to this repository following the journal's embargo lift. A developing version of this project was presented previously at The Obesity Society (TOS) Obesity Week Annual Scientific Meeting in 2018 (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.14800042).

### Code

__File name for search and extraction code:__ manuscript_materials_2020_code_review_search_extraction.R

This file contains the code used to conduct the literature search and extract Almetric and citation data from included studies 

Author: Dr. Cynthia M. Kroeger


__File name for visual development code (review):__ manuscript_materials_2020_code_review_visuals.R

This file contains the code used to generate the figures used in the manuscript that pertain to the results of the review 

Author: Dr. Cynthia M. Kroeger



## A Note on How to Replicate this Study 

Because data for the review were extracted from PubMed on a specific date, one would need to download PubMed history and assess the literature from the point in time noted in the data file, using the methods described in this document. Another option might be to run the search described herein and subtract dates from the date reported in our data file. Visuals and simulation code are replicable as is. 


## Author Contribution 

Dr. Cynthia M. Kroeger lead the survey, originated the idea of implementing Open Science R packages to semi-automate methods, wrote the review code, created the open science documents for the repository, and drafted the manuscript. Dr. Keisuke Ejima assisted with figure generation code and provided editorial assistance with the manuscript. Ms. Bridget A. Hannon and Dr. Tanya M Halliday assisted with the design and conduct of the review and provided editorial assistance with the review materials and manuscript. Dr. Margarita Teran-Garcia contributed to the search strategy and methods for the review and provided editorial assistance with the manuscript. Dr. Andrew W. Brown drafted sections of the manuscript and provided editoral assistance.
